## Hugo framework

The website uses the [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) framework. From the *Hugo* repository:

> Hugo is a static site generator written in Go, optimized for speed and designed for 
> flexibility. With its advanced templating system and fast asset pipelines, Hugo renders a complete site in seconds, often less.

For me, it is my first project with Hugo. So the learning is still an ongoing process - as always in live.
