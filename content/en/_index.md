*sustainable coding and more*

This website is first and foremost for my personal joy and education. I am an 
enthusiastic software developer based in Berlin with roots in the Java eco-sphere.

Besides of my work and projects as a developer, I am committed as an volunteer 
for the [ecogood](https://www.ecogood.org/) movement - with the strongly believe, 
that we need to change the way of living, working and communicating with each other, 
if we want to have a worthwhile future.

So feel invited to send me feedback or your opinion on topics to 
[todo@jguhlke.de](mailto:todo@jguhlke.de) - we can only improve, if we start to 
talk to each other in a non-violent way over our needs and real thoughts.
